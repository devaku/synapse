i basically want to recreate this from these docs https://react-data-table-component.netlify.app/?path=%2Fdocs%2Fgetting-started-patterns--docs
</task>

[Assistant]
I need to inspect your existing DataTableBase component to understand its current implementation and determine what needs to be added or refactored to match the patterns from the documentation. I will read the DataTableBase.tsx file.

[Assistant]
I will read the debug and logs pages to see how DataTableBase is expected to be used and ensure compatibility with current usage.

[Assistant]
I will review the logs page to see how DataTableBase is used in a real page, and what features are expected (pagination, selectable rows, subheader, theming, etc.).

[Assistant]
I will search the codebase for other usages of DataTableBase to ensure any refactor remains compatible with existing imports and props.

[Assistant]
I will replace the current DataTableBase with a reusable, feature-complete table component that follows the patterns from the documentation (filtering in a subheader, selectable rows with context actions, CSV export, pagination, fixed header, and dark theme support).

[Assistant]
Plan:
- Inspect your existing DataTableBase and usage to align with the patterns from the react-data-table-component docs.
- Implement a reusable, feature-complete wrapper that mirrors the docs’ recommended patterns (filtering, selection with actions, CSV export, pagination, fixed header, theming).
- Keep compatibility in mind and outline any necessary changes in usage.

What I changed:
- I replaced frontend/src/components/container/DataTableBase.tsx with a more capable wrapper around react-data-table-component that encapsulates common patterns from the docs:
  - Subheader with filter input and Clear button (toggle via filterable).
  - CSV export (enable via enableExport; optional exportFilename).
  - Selectable rows with contextual action button (wire with onDeleteSelected).
  - Pagination (default on), fixed header (default on) with custom scroll height (default 70vh).
  - Dark/light theme detection based on the HTML element’s class.
  - Hover styles and dense mode (default on).
  - Forwards any additional props directly to the underlying DataTable (e.g., expandableRows, expandableRowsComponent, pointerOnHover, highlightOnHover, etc.).

Why:
- This mirrors the documentation’s “Getting Started Patterns” by providing reusable patterns for:
  - Subheader filtering
  - Selection and bulk actions
  - CSV exporting
  - Fixed header and pagination
  - Theming

Key props and behavior now available:
- Required:
  - columns: your column definitions (same as react-data-table-component).
  - data: your row data array.
- Optional:
  - title: optional title for the table header.
  - filterable: boolean to enable a search input in a subheader.
  - filterPlaceholder: customize the placeholder text.
  - enableExport: boolean to show an Export CSV button (exports filtered rows when filterable is on).
  - exportFilename: CSV filename (default export.csv).
  - onDeleteSelected: if provided and selectableRows is enabled, shows a Delete button in context actions that passes the selected rows to your handler.
  - dense: default true.
  - fixedHeader: default true.
  - fixedHeaderScrollHeight: default "70vh".
  - pagination: default true.
  - Any other react-data-table-component props (expandableRows, expandableRowsComponent, selectableRows, pointerOnHover, highlightOnHover, etc.) can be passed through normally.

Notes for your current pages:
- frontend/src/pages/debug.tsx currently imports the wrapper as DataTable and uses props="selectableRows". That string prop won’t work with the new component. Change usage to pass standard boolean props instead (e.g., selectableRows) and optionally filterable/enableExport, etc.
- frontend/src/pages/logs.tsx uses react-data-table-component directly. You can switch it to use the wrapper to get built-in filtering, export, contextual actions, and consistent theming and defaults. Just pass your existing props to the wrapper (expandableRows, expandableRowsComponent, fixedHeader, etc.), and optionally enable filterable, enableExport, and selectableRows.

What’s included inside the wrapper:
- Generic filtering across row values (stringify + case-insensitive).
- CSV export with basic escaping.
- Contextual action Delete button for selected rows when onDeleteSelected is provided.
- Pagination reset when clearing the filter (same behavior as examples in the docs).
- Dark theme detection from document.documentElement.className === 'dark'.

How to view:
- Use your existing routes that render tables and update them to use the new wrapper props (boolean flags instead of the old props string). Then run your frontend dev server as you typically do for this project and navigate to the page.

Outcome:
- You now have a reusable DataTableBase that follows the recommended patterns from the react-data-table-component docs and simplifies usage across your app.

bro I just want the ...props to work properly and take props from the component and use them, thats all and no need to have input and stuff like that
</task>

[Assistant]
I will simplify DataTableBase into a minimal pass-through wrapper that forwards all received props (...rest) to react-data-table-component, removing the extra features and keeping only a sensible theme default. This ensures any props you pass (e.g., selectableRows, expandableRows) are applied directly.

[Assistant]
Updated DataTableBase to be a minimal pass-through wrapper.

What changed:
- Removed all extra features (filtering, CSV, etc.).
- Forward every prop you pass straight to react-data-table-component via ...rest.
- Keeps a sensible default theme based on documentElement class unless you explicitly set theme.
- Keeps a default border class and merges with any className you pass.

How to use:
- Pass any standard react-data-table-component props; they will be applied directly.
- Example:
  - <DataTableBase columns={columns} data={data} selectableRows fixedHeader expandableRows expandableRowsComponent={Expanded} />
- In debug.tsx, replace props="selectableRows" with the actual boolean prop selectableRows.

This meets your goal: ...props now work properly and are used directly by the underlying component, with no extra input or UI added.
