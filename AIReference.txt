*** For created a json file for testing
        User: give me like… idk… 999 more objects for “data” if possible, keep
        it too like 10 different users and simple descriptions, dont change the
        columns Assistant: I generated 999 more log entries with the same
        structure (10 different users and simple descriptions) and saved them in
        a new file: logs_table_testing_extended.json Would you like me to also
        give you a quick preview sample (e.g., first 5 and last 5 rows) so you
        can see how the data looks before you use it? User: export chat
        Assistant: Do you want me to export this entire chat conversation
        (everything we’ve discussed so far), or just the part related to your
        logs_table_testing.json work?
        I can generate it for you in formats like TXT, DOCX, PDF. Which format
        do you prefer? User: txt

*** For updating test json
        User: add userid, a createdat time or replace timestamp with createdat, add isdeleted boolean of true or false

        Assistant: I’ve updated your JSON:
        - Replaced `timestamp` with `createdAt`
        - Added a new `userID` field (sequentially assigned)
        - Added a new `isDeleted` field (defaulted to `false`)

        You can download the updated file here:
        📂 logs_table_testing_extended_updated.json

        Would you like me to randomize `userID` values (so the same user always has the same ID), instead of just assigning sequential numbers?

        User: give me chat in txt

        Assistant: Here’s the chat saved as a text file:
        📂 chat_export.txt

        User: also give me a more complex userid... and timezone with createdat... then export chat as well to txt

        Assistant: I’ve updated your JSON again:
        - `userID` is now a more complex hashed ID (based on username, 12 hex chars)
        - `createdAt` now includes timezone (stored in ISO 8601 UTC format)
        - `isDeleted` is still `false` by default

        You can download the updated JSON here:
        📂 logs_table_testing_extended_complex.json
